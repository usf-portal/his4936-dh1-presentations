##### Defining Ancient Religion...

**Gaius Aurelius Cotta, De Natura Deorum 3.5**

<p class="text-align-left text-small">The entirety of the religio of the Roman people is divided into rites and auspices, to which is added a third thing, namely whatever warnings the interpreters of the Sibylline books or haruspices issue for the sake of foreknowledge on the basis of portents and omens. I hold that none of these religiones should ever be neglected, and I have persuaded myself that Romulus and Numa laid the foundations of our state by establishing the auspices and rites, respectively, and that our state could never have become so great without the greatest appeasement of the immortal gods.</p>

##### The Universality of Beliefs

**CIL 14.672**

<p class="text-align-left text-small">"Do not walk by this epitaph, but stop, listen, learn, and proceed. There is no boat in Hades, no ferryman Charon, no caretaker Aeacus, no dog Cerberus. All who die become bones and ashes, nothing more. I speak the truth. Go now, traveler, lest I, who is dead, even seem longwinded to you."</p>
